Hi, I’m @rugsrme my name is Quinn and I live in the middle of Missouri in the USA.
I’m interested in finding freelance projects involving Php and Javascript using frameworks and libraries such as Laravel and React.
     I can build full stack web aplications utilizing customized database solutions.
     I’m currently learning to use Livewire and Inertia building SPA's
- 💞️ I would love to work with others on a team to learn the in's and out's of team development.  I am self taught with the vast availability of tutorials and affordable online courses from sites like Udemy.
